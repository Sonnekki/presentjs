Thanks for looking!

This is a really simple presentation framework written in JavaScript.  It does pretty much does everything that PowerPoint can do in under 200 spacious lines of JavaScript.

JQuery was previously used in this implementation but was removed to be extra-framework free.  If you want pretty animations and classy CSS addition things, just uncomment a few lines of code.
